Crowding enhanced diffusion of multivalent binders with intrinsically disordered proteins   

by Simone Pengue, Ludovit P. Zweifel, Adam Mazur, Larisa E. Kapinos, Chantal Rencurel and Roderick Y.H. Lim

The file LAMMPS simultion analysis upload.nb is the analysis file for our LAMMPS coarse grained MD simulations. It runs with the simulations trajectories uploaded on Zenodo: +++

Please note that it is built to work with all the .h5 files available, analysis of single files requires some adaptations

The file fcs Analysis Pengue.nb is the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) analysis presented in the above mentioned manuscript. The notebook is self explanatory and ready to work with any correlation curve exported from Symphotime 64 (PicoQuant).

kapB1_alexa647_7nM alexa_5nM_fcs contains one example file with a mixture of KapB1-alexa647 and alexa647 in aquous solution. 

All the codes have been written by Simone Pengue
